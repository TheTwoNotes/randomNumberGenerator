# randomNumberGenerator
Demonstration app for simple random number generation with UI

This is a simple "as it" app showing a basic user interface created using a struct with SwiftUI. The app has a TextField for entering a numeric value for the maximum number. When the user presses the "Submit" button, the app generates a random number between 1 and the maximum number value entered. If the user enters a non-numeric text or enters a number below the minimum of "1", it defaults to 1 - 100 as the numeric range.
